Abstract. In architectural research, accurate classification of architec-
tural styles is crucial for integrating historical and contemporary design
elements as well as for educational purposes. This paper presents a novel
application of existing Large Language Models (LLMs), including the
GPT-4o model from OpenAI, for architectural style classification tasks.
LLMs are language neural networks with billions of parameters trained
on extensive datasets. GPT-4o, a state-of-the-art LLM, demonstrates
significant potential for achieving Zero-Shot classification capabilities,
comparable to specifically trained supervised classifiers on many tasks. We
explore the model’s Zero-Shot ability to identify and classify architectural
styles without prior specialized training on architectural images. Various
prompt engineering approaches were experimented with to augment the
model’s prior knowledge about architecture, thereby increasing classifi-
cation accuracy. Experimental results indicate that GPT-4o can achieve
classification accuracy comparable to, and even exceeding, traditional con-
volutional neural network (CNN) models without any training. This study
not only highlights the flexibility and potential of large pre-trained models
for architectural style classification but also proposes a new paradigm for
resource-efficient and high-accuracy architectural analysis.

1 Introduction
In architecture and urban design research, the ability to accurately classify
architectural styles from images is critical. It aids architects in blending historical
and modern designs and helps scholars study architectural forms and cultural
connotations [ 8]. Moreover, it is essential for public education and understanding
of architectural knowledge. The reliability and accuracy of architectural style

classification are crucial for the advancement of architectural disciplines and
public learning.[4]
However, architectural styles classification is a challenging task due to the
complex genres and characteristics of architectural details. Unlike generic object
recognition (e.g., classifying everyday items or medical images), architectural
style classification poses unique challenges. Architectural styles are defined by
subtle visual cues, historical context, and overlapping design elements. [ 14]
Identifying common features within a style and distinguishing between different
styles remain significant challenges[ 27]. Traditional machine learning approaches,
like classification based on discriminative models (DPM), often fall short in
accuracy[ 24]. Although deep learning techniques, such as convolutional neural
networks (VGG [ 13], Inception [ 15], ResNet [ 6], GoogLeNet [ 16]), have improved
architectural image classification, they require large, annotated datasets and
substantialcomputationalresources[ 14],andtheydonotfullycapturetheintuitive
and flexible nature of human architectural cognition[5].
To address these limitations, research has shifted towards new technologies
like transfer learning [ 20] and self-supervised learning [ 3]. These aim to enhance
the efficiency and accuracy of image classification, particularly in small or zero-
shot learning scenarios[ 23]. However, these methods still struggle with complex
architectural images[ 11]. The rapid development of AI, especially with LLMs like
GPT-4o, Qwen-VL, and Claude3, offers new possibilities[ 18]. These models, with
their extensive training data and exceptional generalization capabilities, show
substantial potential in architectural style classification.
LLMs excel in understanding complex features, adapting, and analyzing rich
detailsinimages,enhancingclassificationaccuracyandcontextualunderstanding[ 9,18].
This paper focuses on applying the GPT-4o model to architectural style classifi-
cation. Without specific training, GPT-4o uses its extensive pre-trained data to
analyze architectural images through simple and precise prompts, surpassing tra-
ditional models’ limitations. Our research aims to improve GPT-4o’s performance
in architectural style recognition by in-context learning and prompt engineering.
Preliminary experiments indicate that the GPT-4o model, guided by structured
prompts, can match or exceed the classification accuracy of traditional CNN mod-
els [17] under zero-shot conditions[ 26,21]. This demonstrates the broad potential
and flexibility of LLMs in architecture, signaling a new era of resource-efficient
and widely applicable architectural image analysis.
2 State-of-the-Art
2.1 Architectural Style Classification
Over the past decade, architectural style classification has evolved from hand-
crafted feature engineering to deep learning–based methods. Early work by Xu
et al. (2014) built a large-scale dataset (scraped from Wikimedia Commons) and
employed a Deformable Part Model (DPM) plus latent logistic regression to detect
components (e.g., doors, windows) and infer style labels probabilistically[ 24].
Title Suppressed Due to Excessive Length 3
While this approach was foundational and forward-looking, its accuracy remained
limited, particularly for visually overlapping styles.
With the rise of deep learning, researchers adopted CNNs (e.g., VGG, ResNet)
to automate feature extraction, significantly boosting classification performance
[24] . Llamas et al.(2017) found deep features particularly effective for heritage
images[8], while Yoshimura et al.(2019) categorized contemporary designs via
fine-tuned CNNs [ 25]. However, these models typically require large labeled
datasets and may struggle with styles demanding contextual knowledge (e.g.,
distinguishing Renaissance vs Neoclassical by construction era).
To address data and complexity issues, intermediate strategies emerged.
Chen et al. (2021) proposed hierarchical multi-label classification, recognizing
that buildings can exhibit multiple style traits[ 1]. Xia et al. (2020) classified
residential styles by clustering formal elements (like roofs, windows) into fixed
combinations[ 22]. Additionally, attention mechanisms (Wang et al. 2023) have
helped localize subtle style indicators such as Gothic arches[17].
Despite these advances, architectural styles can overlap and evolve, compli-
cating rigid classification boundaries. Recent studies[ 7,26] introduced few-shot
and zero-shot approaches, acknowledging the impracticality of labeling every
possible style. Our approach aligns with this direction by eliminating the need
for dedicated training through a powerful pre-trained model.
2.2 Zero-Shot Visual Recognition and Visual Language Models
Zero-shotlearning(ZSL)enablesclassificationofcategoriesunseenduringtraining
by relying on auxiliary semantic information (e.g., textual descriptions, word
embeddings). Traditional vision models struggle with truly novel classes because
they learn direct image-to-label mappings. By contrast, ZSL methods transfer
knowledge from known classes to unseen ones, often via textual or ontological
representations [19].
Large language models (LLMs) and vision-language models (VLMs) have
significantly advanced ZSL performance. Their training in massive datasets, which
span both text and images, gives them a broad world knowledge and adaptable
feature representations [ 21]. Chen et al. (2023), for example, demonstrated how
a vision-enabled LLM could interpret chest X-rays for COVID-19 diagnosis in a
few-shot setting, underscoring its cross-domain inference capacity[ 2]. Similarly,
Wu et al. (2023) benchmarked a vision-language model on tasks including scene
recognition and texture classification, confirming robust zero-shot capability[ 21].
In architecture, Zeng et al. (2024) applied such a model to estimate building
ages from façade images in a zero-shot manner. By linking visual clues (orna-
mental details, structural design) with historical knowledge, the model inferred
approximate construction periods without style-specific pre-training[ 26]. Inspired
by these successes, we adopt a similar paradigm for architectural style classifica-
tion. Rather than training a CNN on thousands of labeled examples[ 24], we rely
on a multi-modal large model’s existing “knowledge” and prompt it to identify
styles. This approach aligns with the broader trend of leveraging LLM/VLM
flexibility for specialized tasks that lack exhaustive training datasets.
4 Li et al.
In summary, while architectural style classification has seen progress through
CNN-based pipelines and element-based clustering[ 17,12,24,8], zero-shot learning
with vision-language models offers a new path[ 26,21]. By uniting visual analysis
and contextual knowledge, these models reduce dependency on labeled data and
canrecognizenuancedstylefeaturesthatmightbeoverlookedbypurelysupervised
methods[ 10]. Our work builds upon these insights and aims to demonstrate the
feasibility of zero-shot style identification in a domain where styles are inherently
multi-dimensional and often under-labeled.
3 Methods
3.1 Datasets and Ethical
We evaluated our approach on the architectural style image dataset (Fig. 1)
originally constructed by Xu et al[ 24]. This dataset was collected from the
“Architecture by style” entries on Wikipedia (Wikimedia Commons), using a
systematic crawl to gather photographs of building exteriors for a wide range of
styles[24]. It covers both well-known styles (e.g., Gothic, Baroque, Modernist)
and more region-specific or era-specific styles (e.g., Achaemenid, Russian Revival).
Each style in the dataset contains roughly 60 to 400 images, with a total of nearly
5,000 images across all categories. All images are in color with roughly 800 ×600
resolution, capturing buildings such as churches, houses, museums, and other
structures, each labeled by architectural style.
Fig.1.Features of the dataset.
Title Suppressed Due to Excessive Length 5
For our experiments, we considered two classification scenarios: 10-class and
25-class subsets task (see Fig. 1). In the 10-class task, we use a selection of ten
styles that are relatively easier to distinguish visually (American Craftsman,
Baroque, Chicago School, Colonial, Georgian, Gothic, Greek Revival, Queen
Anne, Romanesque, Russian Revival). The 25-class task uses a much broader set
of styles (essentially the full dataset, comprising 25 style categories including the
above and others such as Art Deco, Art Nouveau, International, Tudor Revival,
etc.). The 25-class scenario is significantly more challenging, as it contains stylistic
nuances and several styles that have overlapping features.
We also acknowledge several ethical considerations regarding the dataset
and model behavior. This dataset is sourced from Wikipedia Commons under
open/fair-use licenses, used solely for research. However, it may overrepresent Eu-
ropean and North American architecture, leaving other regions underrepresented.
GPT-4o, trained mostly on Western data, could thus favor well-documented
styles. While style classification is benign in nature, it can still reflect cultural
narratives (e.g., defining “canonical” Gothic). We highlight where the model
struggles and encourage diverse data to mitigate these biases.
3.2 Overall Experiment Design
Our experimental framework leverages GPT-4o’s multimodal (vision+language)
capabilities through strategic prompting. The goal is to assess and improve
the zero-shot classification of architectural styles by providing the model with
additional context in various ways. We devised four methods (see Fig. 2) that
progressively increase the amount of guidance given to GPT-4o when it analyzes
an image. Below we describe each method and the rationale behind choosing
these four:

–Method 1 (GPT4o-Vision-DIRECT): This is the most straightforward
baseline. We present the architectural image to GPT-4o with a simple prompt
asking for the architectural style. Essentially, GPT-4o is directly tasked with

labeling the image’s style in one step. No extra context or information is
given beyond the image itself. This tests the model’s raw zero-shot ability
using its internal knowledge.
–Method 2 (GPT4o-Vision-TAGS-ONLY): In this method, we introduce
an intermediate step of feature extraction. GPT-4o first generates concise
architectural tags from the image (e.g., “pointed arch, flying buttress, stained
glass”), representing key stylistic elements. These tags are then used—without
the image—as input to a second GPT-4o prompt that compares them against
style descriptions to infer the most likely style. This two-step approach
(Image→Tags→Style) aims to enhance classification by focusing the
model’s reasoning on explicit architectural features.
–Method 3 (GPT4o-Vision-PIC+TAGS): This method combines the
image and the previously generated tags as joint input to GPT-4o, along
with style descriptions. The goal is to let the model leverage both raw visual
input and distilled feature cues. Tags serve to direct attention toward key
elements, while the image allows visual verification. We test whether this
multimodal setup improves classification over using tags alone.
–Method 4 (GPT4o-Vision-PIC+TAGS+REASON): Building on
Method 3, this approach adds a requirement for reasoning. GPT-4o receives
the image, tags, and style descriptions (see Fig. 3), and is prompted to justify
its classification with a brief explanation. This encourages “chain-of-thought”

reasoning and enhances interpretability. Even if accuracy gains are minimal,
the added rationale offers insight and confidence in model predictions.
Fig.3.Detail explanation of style in prompt.
To summarize, these four methods were intentionally designed to evaluate
how incremental additions of context affect GPT-4o’s zero-shot classification
performance. Method 1 serves as a baseline with direct querying. Method 2 adds
textual context by translating visual input into tags, testing whether language-
based reasoning alone improves results. Method 3 combines image and tags as
multimodal input to assess whether cross-verification enhances accuracy. Method
4 introduces explanatory reasoning to test model consistency and interpretability.
Together, these methods reveal the trade-offs between simplicity, predictive
performance, and transparency
3.3 Prompt Engineering Workflow
To implement Methods 2–4, we designed a two-stage prompt workflow, using two
query prompts Q1 and Q2 in sequence for each image (for Method 1, only one
prompt is needed). We formalize the process as follows:
Stage 1 (Q1 – Tag Extraction): We input the image I to GPT-4o with an
initial prompt Q1 (Fig. 4)that instructs the model to analyze the image and
output a set of descriptive tags or short phrases capturing key architectural
features. Formally, we denote this as:
T=gGPT -4o(I;Q1)
8 Li et al.
Fig.4.Q1: Prompt of analyzing tags.
Here, gGPT-4o (I;Q1)represents GPT-4o’s operation on image Iwith prompt
Q1, producing T, the set of tags. The prompt Q1 is carefully worded to ensure
the tags are relevant to architectural style (e.g., “List distinctive architectural
features you observe, in a few words each.”). This stage leverages GPT-4o’s
deep semantic understanding of the image, translating visual details into textual
descriptors. (Fig. 4) shows an example of such Q1 and its tag output. In our
running example, I(a cathedral image) might yield T=["pointed arch", "flying
buttress", "stained glass", "tall spire"].
Stage 2 (Q2 – Style Reasoning): Next, we craft a follow-up prompt Q2
(Fig. 5) that provides context about architectural styles and asks GPT-4o to
identify the style given the information from Stage 1. We feed GPT-4o with T
(the tags from Stage 1) and, depending on the method, optionally the image I
again, plus explanatory text about possible styles. In general, we denote this
reasoning stage as:
(S∧,R∧) =F(gGPT−4o(I;Q1);Q2)
Where S∧is the predicted style label and R∧is an optional detailed expla-
nation. The function Frepresents GPT-4o’s reasoning process under prompt
Q2, which may incorporate both the tags Tand the image I. For Method 2, F
takes only T(no image) with a prompt that lists styles and asks “Given these
features, which style fits best?” For Method 3, Ftakes (T, I)so the model can
inspect the image while considering the tags. For Method 4, Ftakes (T, I)with
an expanded prompt that says, for example, “Determine the style and explain

your reasoning. Here are some known architectural styles and their characteristics:
... [list]. The image features are: [tags].” The output includes both S∧andR∧
(the model’s explanation). (Fig. 5) illustrates an example of Q2 for Method 3. In
our example, Q2 might contain descriptions of Gothic, Romanesque, Renaissance
styles, etc., and GPT-4o would output S∧=Gothic, with R∧=“The building
has tall pointed arches, flying buttresses, and large stained-glass windows, which
are characteristic of Gothic architecture.”
This two-stage prompt engineering allows GPT-4o to flexibly perform multi-
step reasoning: first as a visual analyst, then as a domain expert. Importantly, it
uses GPT-4o “in context” learning abilities – we do not fine-tune the model, only
guide it with carefully chosen textual context.
Having set up the methods, we next describe our experiments and results.
4 Results and Discussion
In this section, we present a comprehensive analysis of our results and discuss their
implications. We begin by examining the feature tags generated by our approach
to verify how they contribute to classification accuracy and interpretability. We
then evaluate our zero-shot architectural style classification framework (based on
GPT-4o) in comparison with a broad range of benchmark models, from classical
hand-crafted feature methods to state-of-the-art deep learning and large language
models. This evaluation encompasses both a 10-class task (a subset of styles)
and a more challenging 25-class task (the full style set). We further analyze the
outcomes through a confusion matrix to understand which architectural styles are
easily recognized and which are frequently confused. Next, we provide a per-style
performance breakdown with key metrics (precision, recall, F1-score, accuracy),
explaining what each metric indicates in the context of architectural classification.
10 Li et al.
Finally, we discuss the practical application of the GPT-4o model in a zero-shot
setting, highlighting the significance of our tag-assisted methodology and its
long-term potential in architectural style recognition.
4.1 Tags Features Analysis
Understanding visual tags extracted from images is crucial for interpreting how
the model distinguishes architectural styles. We visualized tag frequency and
interrelationships using word clouds and network graphs (Fig. 6). The word
cloud displays frequently occurring descriptors in larger font, while the network
graph connects commonly co-occurring tags, showing how architectural features
correlate. This visualization reveals which features the model "sees" most often
and how they group into higher-level concepts.
Fig.6.Tags word clouds and network analysis.
We filtered generic environmental and photographic tags ("daytime," "blue
sky," "trees," etc.) to focus on distinctive architectural characteristics. The top
ten distinctive tags were: "symmetrical design," "outdoor," "historic building,"
"columns," "cultural heritage," "facade," "historical building," "street view,"
"modern architecture," and "religious building." These correspond to salient
features associated with particular styles—"columns" and "symmetrical design"
often signal classical architecture, while "modern architecture" implies contempo-
rary styles. Tags like "historical building" suggest the model recognizes antiquity
cues that correlate with historical styles.
The network graph reveals how architectural features co-occur. Connected tag
clusters show feature groups that appear together in images. For example, "trees"
links with "residential building," "lawn," and "front yard," indicating residential
styles often include greenery settings. Similarly, "urban setting" connects to
Title Suppressed Due to Excessive Length 11
"modern architecture" and "office building," showing modern styles frequently
appear in urban environments. These linkages demonstrate that the model
captures both isolated features and contextual associations, helping explain its
reasoning: when features consistently appear together, GPT-4o can leverage that
information for more informed predictions.

visual cues and their relationships, we confirm the model leverages meaningful
architectural features rather than random patterns. Understanding feature impor-
tance and interconnectedness aids classification—the clearer we discern defining
style tags, the more accurately the model interprets new images. The tags serve
as an interpretable bridge between raw images and style predictions, providing
insights into architectural characteristics and enabling more accurate, explainable
interpretations.
4.2 Benchmark Experiments
As seen in (Fig. 7). To evaluate the performance of our zero-shot GPT-4o
classifier, we compared it against a diverse set of baseline methods, ranging from
traditional hand-crafted features to modern deep learning and large multimodal
models. These baselines include: (1) rule-based global descriptors such as GIST
and Spatial Pyramid Matching (SP), which use engineered features without
learning; (2) object- and mid-level representations like Object Bank (OB) and
MLLR+SR, which add semantic structure by encoding object-level patterns;
(3) classical supervised classifiers, including enhanced Deformable Part Model
variants (e.g., DPM-LSVM, DPM-MLLR, DPM+IEP-SVM), which integrate
hand-crafted or intermediate features with training; and (4) deep learning models,
such as the Nonlinear Consensus Style Centralized Autoencoder (NCSCAE)
and pretrained CNNs like Inception-v3, both with and without architectural
attention modules (e.g., CSAM). Finally, we evaluated GPT-4o alongside other
state-of-the-art multimodal LLMs like Qwen-VL and Claude-3, both capable of
zero-shot image-language classification.
Each method was tested under two classification scenarios: a 10-class task
focusing on broader distinctions, and a more fine-grained 25-class task. The results
reveal a consistent trend: GPT-4o achieved the highest accuracy in both settings,
outperforming all baselines without any additional training. Its performance
not only surpassed rule-based and supervised models—which depend heavily
on labeled datasets—but also exceeded that of other advanced zero-shot LLMs.
This outcome underscores GPT-4o’s strong generalization capabilities, driven by
large-scale image-text pretraining and its ability to reason contextually about
architectural features.
4.3 Benchmark Result Discussion
To clarify performance differences, baseline methods are categorized into three
types: (a) rule-based feature extractors (e.g., GIST, SP), (b) supervised classifiers
12 Li et al.
Fig.7.Accuracy of each method for 10 and 25 classes.
(e.g.,DPMvariants,Inception-v3),and(c)largemultimodalmodels(e.g.,GPT-4o,
Claude-3, Qwen-VL), each evaluated on both 10-class and 25-class tasks.
Rule-based methods offered minimal discriminative power, relying on low-
level image descriptors that proved insufficient for capturing the nuanced features
of architectural styles. Their performance dropped sharply on the 25-class task,
confirming their limitations in complex, fine-grained classification.
Supervised learning models , including traditional SVM and CNN-based
approaches, achieved stronger results, particularly when using pretrained models
like Inception-v3. The inclusion of architectural attention mechanisms (e.g.,
CSAM) further improved accuracy. However, these methods require extensive
labeled datasets and training, limiting scalability and adaptability to new or rare
styles.
Multimodal LLMs , especially GPT-4o, outperformed all baselines. Op-
erating in zero-shot mode, GPT-4o achieved 86.1% accuracy on the 10-class
task and approximately 63.4% on the more challenging 25-class task. This was
accomplished without any fine-tuning, demonstrating its strong generalization
ability derived from large-scale image-text pretraining. Comparable models like
Claude-3 and Qwen-VL also showed solid performance, but GPT-4o had a clear
edge, likely due to its broader training corpus and superior contextual reasoning.
Among GPT-4o prompting strategies, the “PIC+TAGS” configuration (im-
age plus feature tags) yielded the highest accuracy. Adding reasoning steps
(“PIC+TAGS+REASON”) did not improve results significantly, suggesting that
interpretability may come at a slight trade-off in precision. Nonetheless, the
model’s ability to explain its predictions remains a valuable feature.
Title Suppressed Due to Excessive Length 13
In summary, GPT-4o not only rivals but often surpasses traditional super-
vised models, offering a flexible, data-efficient approach to architectural style
classification. Its success highlights the strength of combining visual input with
language-driven context in complex recognition tasks.
4.4 Confusion Matrix Evaluation
To better understand the model’s performance across categories, we analyzed the
25-class confusion matrix (Fig. 8). The matrix shows how often each architectural
style was correctly identified (diagonal values) versus misclassified as another (off-
diagonal values). Styles with distinct visual identities—such as Ancient Egyptian
and Art Deco—were classified with particularly high accuracy. For example,
Ancient Egyptian achieved a perfect score with 256/256 correct predictions, and
Art Deco similarly reached 320 correct identifications, with minimal confusion.
These results demonstrate that the model is highly reliable when styles exhibit
clear, iconic features such as monumental stone forms or geometric ornamentation.
Fig.8.Confusion Matrix.
14 Li et al.
However, the matrix also reveals consistent confusion patterns among visually
or historically related styles. A notable case is the misclassification of Romanesque
buildings as Gothic: 27 Romanesque examples were predicted as Gothic, whereas
only 13 Gothic buildings were misclassified in the reverse direction. This reflects
their architectural continuity—Romanesque’s round arches and heavy massing
vs. Gothic’s pointed arches and verticality—and indicates the model tends to
default to the more elaborate Gothic label when overlap occurs. Similarly, Queen
Anne is frequently confused with American Craftsman: out of 140 Queen Anne
images, only 66 were correctly identified, while 30 were misclassified as Craftsman.
The stylistic proximity of these residential types—both characterized by porches,
pitched roofs, and wood detailing—makes accurate classification challenging, espe-
cially when ornamental features are subdued. Additional confusion was observed
between Beaux-Arts and Edwardian, with 33 Edwardian images misclassified as
Beaux-Arts, further highlighting the model’s sensitivity to transitions between
adjacent formal traditions.
These confusion patterns point to areas for improvement. Most misclassifica-
tions occur where styles share key visual elements, temporal overlap, or functional
typologies. Enhancing the prompt with finer-grained contextual cues—such as
structural systems, material palettes, or decorative richness—could help disam-
biguate similar styles. Alternatively, secondary prompts or rule-based checks
could be introduced to verify classification in known-confusion zones. In summary,
while the model performs exceptionally well with stylistically distinct categories,
the confusion matrix clearly highlights boundaries where visual similarity leads
to ambiguity. Addressing these edge cases is crucial for enhancing the robustness
and interpretability of zero-shot architectural style classification.
4.5 Analysis for Each Style
To assess classification performance in detail, we computed standard evaluation
metrics for 25 architectural style: Precision, Recall, F1-score, and Accuracy
(Fig. 9).Precision reflects how often a predicted label is correct—that is, among
all images the model predicted as a given style, what proportion truly belong to
that style. Recallshows how often the true class was correctly detected—among
all images that actually belong to a style, how many were successfully identified.
F1provides a balanced measure of both, serving as the harmonic mean of
precision and recall.
We also report Accuracy as a per-class measure, defined as the percentage
of all images (across all styles) that were correctly identified with respect to a
specific style—this includes both true positives and true negatives. However, due
to the class imbalance in the dataset (i.e., far more images not of a given style
than of that style), this metric can appear deceptively high even for classes where
the model performs poorly. For this reason, we emphasize precision and recall in
our discussion, as they more directly reflect classification behavior for each style.
Two supporting counts further contextualize the metrics: n(Truth) , which in-
dicatesthenumberofimagesthattrulybelongtoagivenstyle,and N(Classified) ,
which represents the number of images that the model predicted as that style,
Title Suppressed Due to Excessive Length 15
regardless of correctness. These values form the denominators for recall and
precision, respectively.
The overall precision of the 25-class task was 63%, a strong result for zero-shot
performance in a fine-grained classification task. In the following discussion, we
report precision, recall, and F1-score in that order (e.g., Achaemenid: 1.00 / 0.95
/ 0.97).
Fig.9.Evaluation Matrix.
Themodelexcelsonstyleswithhighlydistinctivevisualidentities.Achaemenid
(1.00, 0.95, 0.97), Ancient Egyptian (0.93 / 1.00 / 0.96), and Russian Revival
(0.99 / 0.86 / 0.92) showed exceptional metrics, confirming GPT-4o’s ability
to recognize iconic features like monumental columns, hieroglyphs, or colorful
onion domes. Chicago School and Novelty also scored F1 > 0.80, reflecting strong
detection of styles with localized or consistent design traits.
By contrast, the model struggled with styles that have less distinctive features
or overlap with others. American Foursquare had low precision (0.24) and moder-
ate recall (0.52), suggesting frequent confusion with other domestic styles such as
Craftsman or Colonial. Baroque (0.32 / 0.95 / 0.48) and Byzantine (0.39 / 0.79 /
0.52) showed high recall but very low precision, indicating over-prediction—likely
16 Li et al.
due to mislabeling other ornate styles as Baroque or Byzantine. These findings
align with the confusion matrix and highlight the challenge of distinguishing
richly decorated, historically adjacent styles.
Some styles showed imbalanced performance. Art Nouveau had perfect preci-
sion (1.00) but only 0.63 recall—implying the model labeled examples conserva-
tively and missed subtle cases. Beaux-Arts (0.61 / 0.80 / 069) and Edwardian
(0.70 / 0.21 / 0.32) exhibited moderate precision-recall tradeoffs, while Georgian
had uniformly poor scores (0.24 / 0.21 / 0.23), likely due to visual similarity with
other classical residential forms. Postmodern is another edge case: high precision
(0.88) but very low recall (0.13), meaning the model rarely predicts it, but is
accurate when it does.
These style-level metrics suggest improvement opportunities lie in better
distinguishing overlapping or underrepresented styles. For instance, International
Style had a recall of 0.78 but only 0.20 precision—often over-predicted. Refining
prompts or tags to emphasize unique visual cues (e.g., materiality, ornamentation
level, structural logic) may address these gaps. Additionally, pairing GPT-4o’s
predictions with rule-based disambiguation for high-confusion pairs may further
improve performance.
4.6 GPT Application
In this study, we present a zero-shot architectural style classification GPT based
on our GPT-4o-TAGS+PICS methodology. This approach harnesses the advanced
multimodal capabilities of GPT-4o, combining descriptive architectural feature
tags with predictive prompts to classify styles without the need for any model
fine-tuning or pre-training on specific architectural datasets. As illustrated in
(Fig. 10), users can simply upload a building image directly into the ChatGPT
interface for instant analysis.
Upon image upload, the system processes visual features, aligns them with
relevant architectural tags, and returns a predicted style along with a concise
explanation for the classification. This intuitive workflow delivers not only high
accuracy but also valuable insights into the distinctive features that define
architectural styles.
We invite researchers, historians, and design practitioners to explore our
tool by visiting Zero-Shot Architectural Style Classification. This application
represents a meaningful advancement in computational architectural analysis,
offering a fast, accessible, and explainable method for interpreting architectural
typologies across diverse image inputs.
5 Conclusion
We introduced a novel zero-shot method for architectural style classification using
alargelanguagemodelwithvisioncapabilities(GPT-4o).Ourexperimentsshowed
that this approach can achieve accuracy comparable to supervised baselines, all
while requiring no labeled training data. By carefully engineering prompts, we

leveraged GPT-4o’s extensive learned knowledge to analyze both visual and
textual cues—effectively blending “machine vision” with “architectural intuition.”
This leads to a flexible, interpretable alternative to traditional pipelines, as the
model can articulate its reasoning in natural language.
5.1 Contributions
Our work offers a fresh tool for architectural computing, enabling rapid yet
robust style classification that could benefit research in architectural history,
style evolution, or educational contexts. More broadly, it illustrates how a single,
generalist large model can be guided via prompt engineering to handle a special-
ized domain task. We also highlight recurrent challenges such as certain stylistic
confusions, emphasizing the importance of well-designed prompts to steer the
model’s reasoning effectively.
5.2 Longevity and Future Relevance
Some may view this zero-shot method as a short-lived approach specific to GPT-
4o, but we argue that its relevance is likely to grow. Ongoing developments in
multimodal models (e.g., the next generations of large vision-language systems)
will likely bring even stronger zero-shot capabilities. Our framework is largely
model-agnostic: any sufficiently advanced model that can process images and text
could be substituted, potentially achieving higher accuracy or fewer errors with
each iteration of training. As AI’s visual understanding continues to improve,
the need for exhaustive, task-specific datasets could diminish for a wide range of
classification applications, making methods like ours increasingly appealing.
18 Li et al.
5.3 Limitations and Future Work
Despite promising results, our approach does come with certain limitations:
–Black-box reliance: GPT-4o heavily depends on prompts, and we have
limited means of adjusting its internal representation. If specific styles are
repeatedly confused, we cannot fine-tune in the usual sense but must rely on
further prompt refinements or wait for future model updates.
–Bias and subjectivity: Although we did not detect overt bias in style
classifications, large models can inherit societal or historical biases from their
training data. Researchers should ensure prompts remain neutral and avoid
eliciting subjective or value-laden responses about architectural aesthetics or
design.
–Multi-label classification: Architectural styles commonly overlap (e.g.,
Baroque structures with Gothic remnants). GPT-4o might acknowledge
multiple influences in free-form text, but our current evaluation protocol
expects a single label. Future work could adopt partial-credit or multi-label
schemes to better capture stylistic nuance.
–Integrating Additional Feature Extraction Modules: While GPT-4o
excels in zero-shot classification via prompt engineering, it may overlook
subtle architectural features, particularly in images with overlapping or
nuanced style cues. Pre-trained networks such as GoogLeNet or IEP could be
employed to produce domain-specific descriptors (e.g., localized architectural
elements, textual summaries of structural details). These outputs would then
serve as additional prompts or context for GPT-4o—without fine-tuning
the large model itself—thus enhancing zero-shot performance by providing
richer visual cues. This synergistic approach retains the flexibility of zero-
shot classification while incorporating specialized architectural insights from
traditional computer vision pipelines.
5.4 Outlook
Zero-shot architectural style classification using LLMs signals a new paradigm
that fuses image recognition with broad contextual knowledge. Although we
focused on style labels, the same principles can extend to other architectural
or urban classification tasks by crafting suitable prompts. As large multimodal
models evolve, their enhanced visual–textual reasoning could further reduce the
need for labeled data, making zero-shot solutions both practical and adaptable.
We hope this study stimulates deeper exploration of prompt-driven classification,
multi-label handling, and the integration of cultural knowledge within intelligent
systems. Ultimately, our findings underscore a shift toward more general, less
data-intensive AI strategies in architecture and design—one that promises to
reshape future workflows in both research and practice.
